    <h1 class="title">da Vinci Surgical Systems: By the Numbers</h1>
    <p class="copy">
      The da Vinci surgical system gives your surgeon an advanced set of instruments to use in performing robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The term "robotic" often misleads people. Robots don't perform surgery. Your surgeon performs surgery with da Vinci by using instruments that he or she guides via a console.
      <ul class="copy">
        <li><span class="numbers">5,000,000</span> da Vinci patients and counting</li>
        <li><span class="numbers">43,000</span> da Vinci trained surgeons</li>
        <li><span class="numbers">15,000</span> peer-reviewed publications on da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery</li>
        <li><span class="numbers">4,409+</span> da Vinci Systems in hospitals worldwide</li>
        <li><span class="numbers">4,380+</span> employees</li>
        <li><span class="numbers">2,700</span> patents with <span class="numbers">1,900</span> more pending</li>
        <li>Every <span class="numbers">36</span> seconds a surgeon starts a da Vinci procedure</li>
        <li>All of these numbers add up to <span class="numbers">1</span> surgeon working on improving lives <span class="numbers">1</span> patient at a time</li>
      </ul>
      <span class="conclusion">We strive to make surgery more effective, less invasive, and easier on surgeons, patients, and their families.</span>
